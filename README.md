Electric Vehicles Market Analysis & Forecasting

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes trends in the electric vehicle (EV) market using real-world population data. The analysis explores EV adoption trends, geographic distributions, vehicle types, and manufacturer popularity. Additionally, a forecasting model predicts future EV market growth.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv, containing details on electric vehicles, including:

Model Year

County & City

Electric Vehicle Type

Make & Model

Electric Range (miles)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Forecasting (Curve fitting with scipy.optimize.curve_fit)

📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations

1️⃣ EV Adoption Over Time

Analyzed how EV registrations have increased over the years using bar charts.

2️⃣ Geographic Distribution of EVs

Identified top counties and cities with the highest EV adoption.

3️⃣ EV Type & Manufacturer Trends

Examined the most common EV types and top manufacturers.

4️⃣ Electric Range Analysis

Studied EV battery range trends, showing improvements over model years.

5️⃣ Future EV Market Forecasting

Used an exponential growth model to predict EV adoption trends up to 2029.

📈 Forecasting Model

Applied curve fitting to model the exponential growth of EV registrations.

Forecasted future EV adoption based on historical trends.
